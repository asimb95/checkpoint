# Checkpoint - Lightweight Local Code Snapshots

**Checkpoint** is a simple Bash script that allows developers to save and manage temporary snapshots of modified and untracked files in a Git repository **without committing them**. This is useful when you want to save a temporary version of your code and return to it later.

## üöÄ Features
- Create a checkpoint of modified and untracked files.
- List all saved checkpoints.
- Restore a checkpoint to recover previous changes.

## üì• Installation

1. **Download the script:**
   ```
   curl -o ~/bin/checkpoint https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asimb95/checkpoint/refs/heads/master/checkpoint
   
   ```

2. **Make it executable:**
   ```
   chmod +x ~/bin/checkpoint
   ```

3. **Ensure it‚Äôs in your PATH:**
   ```
   echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc for zsh users
   source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
   ```

## üìå Usage

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Save a checkpoint
```
checkpoint commit -m "Refactored API calls"
```
This will:
- Archive all modified and untracked files into a `.zip` file inside `.checkpoints/`.
- Store metadata (message, timestamp, file list) in a `.json` file.

If no message is provided, it will prompt you to enter one.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ List available checkpoints
```
checkpoint ls
```
Outputs a table with:
- Checkpoint filename
- Number of files
- Message provided

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Restore a checkpoint
```
checkpoint restore checkpoint-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.zip
```
Extracts the files from the specified checkpoint.


## üîß Example Workflow

You're working on a feature branch and have uncommitted changes, but you're unsure if your approach will work. Instead of committing, you save a checkpoint:

```
checkpoint commit -m "New layout is working"
```

After testing, if the approach fails, restore the checkpoint:

```
checkpoint restore checkpoint-2025-03-01_14-30-00.zip
```

This brings back the saved state **without committing anything to Git**.

## üîç How It Works

### Creating a Checkpoint (commit)

When you run:

   checkpoint commit -m "My checkpoint message"

1. The script detects all modified and untracked files in your Git repository.
2. It compresses these files into a `.zip` archive inside the `.checkpoints/` directory.
3. A metadata file (`.json` format) is saved alongside the archive, storing:
   - Timestamp
   - Message
   - List of included files
   - Number of files

If no message is provided, the script prompts you to enter one.

### Listing Checkpoints (ls)

When you run:

   checkpoint ls

The script scans the `.checkpoints/` directory and displays a table of saved checkpoints, showing:

- Filename
- Number of files included
- Checkpoint message

### Restoring a Checkpoint (restore)

To restore a checkpoint, use:

   checkpoint restore checkpoint-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.zip

1. The script extracts the `.zip` file in your project directory.
2. It overwrites existing files with their saved versions.
3. Untracked files in the checkpoint are restored as well.

This allows you to revert to a previous development state without affecting your Git history.
